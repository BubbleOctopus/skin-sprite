# Skin Sprite
Yet another solution for change day night mode **without recreate activity**
Inspired by appcompat-v7

# How it works
When we change the UiMode, we call the `SkinnableActivity` to notify every view in the hierarchy to call `applyDayNight`
if it implements the `Skinnable` interface.

We record the resource id in view constructor when inflate it, and get current resource after apply UiMode in `applyDayNight` function.
